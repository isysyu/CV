#Overview

### Project 1: Camera Calibration

A camera calibration system implemented without using OpenCV library, focused on computing homography, intrinsic, and extrinsic matrices from mathematical principles. The implementation utilizes SVD and Cholesky decomposition for matrix calculations, demonstrating the fundamental mathematics behind camera parameter estimation and geometric transformations.

### Project 2: Image Colorization

An automatic colorization system for Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate photographs that aligns and combines separate color channel images. The implementation incorporates Sobel edge detection, multi-scale processing, and NCC-based alignment techniques, achieving robust channel registration through adaptive threshold selection and seamless image blending.

### Project 3: Structure from Motion

A 3D reconstruction system that generates three-dimensional scene structures from multiple two-dimensional images. The implementation covers the complete SfM pipeline, including SIFT feature matching, fundamental matrix estimation using RANSAC, and 3D point triangulation through camera pose estimation.

### Project 4: Motion Analysis

A motion analysis system that processes sequential image pairs to compute optical flow and track movement patterns. The implementation includes feature detection, motion vector calculation, and visualization components, enabling quantitative analysis of object movements across image sequences.
